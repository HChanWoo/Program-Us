```python

def solution(ability, number):
    answer = 0
    sorted_ability = []

    for ele in ability :
        heapq.heappush(sorted_ability,ele)
        
    for _ in range(number) :
        pop1 = heapq.heappop(sorted_ability)
        pop2 = heapq.heappop(sorted_ability)

        sum_pop = pop1+pop2

        heapq.heappush(sorted_ability,sum_pop)
        heapq.heappush(sorted_ability,sum_pop)

    answer=sum(sorted_ability)
    return answer
